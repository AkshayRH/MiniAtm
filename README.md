It includes necessary header files for input/output, string manipulation, file handling, and vectors.

It defines a struct called Account to represent user account information, including the full name, PIN, and balance.

It declares a global vector called accounts to store instances of the Account struct, effectively representing multiple user accounts.

The program defines several functions:

login(): Allows a user to log in by entering their full name and PIN. Once logged in, the user can perform actions like depositing money, withdrawing money, checking their balance, and logging out.
registr(): Allows a user to register a new account by providing their full name and PIN. The new account is added to the accounts vector.
saveUserData(): Writes the user account data to a text file called "BankInfo.txt."
loadUserData(): Reads user account data from the "BankInfo.txt" file and populates the accounts vector.
findAccount(): Searches for a user account in the accounts vector based on the provided full name and PIN.
In the main() function, the program presents a menu to the user with options to log in, register a new account, or exit. Depending on the user's choice, it calls the corresponding function. The program continues running until the user chooses to exit.

Inside the login() function, the program allows users to perform banking operations like depositing and withdrawing money while keeping track of their account balance. Users can also log out and return to the main menu.

Inside the registr() function, the program allows users to create a new account by providing their full name and PIN. The new account is added to the accounts vector.

The program uses file I/O to save and load user account data, ensuring that user account information is persistent between program runs.

The program provides basic error handling for cases like incorrect PINs, insufficient balances, and exceeding withdrawal limits.

The program clears the console screen (system("cls")) to improve user interface and readability.

Overall, this code is a simple demonstration of how to create a basic ATM system using C++. However, it should be noted that the code may have room for improvements and error handling enhancements, and it is described as "not perfect" and "still in testing and under development" in the comments. Additionally, in a real-world scenario, more robust security measures and data validation would be necessary to ensure the security and integrity of user accounts.
